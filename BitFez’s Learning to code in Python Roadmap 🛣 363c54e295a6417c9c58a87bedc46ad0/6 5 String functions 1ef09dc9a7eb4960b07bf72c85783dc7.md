# 6.5 String functions

String functions are useful actions we can apply to a string. I will not give you tasks on these functions. You will be able to pick out in future lessons where they may be useful or you may notice me using them in other examples.

# The `len()` function

This can be used to determine the length of a string. Or in other words how many characters there are (including spaces).
