# 22 - writing to files

This will be a short lesson and the end of my learning to code in Python roadmap series ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

When opening files, you used 2 arguments with the `open()` function; The filename followed by the `"r"` to open the file for reading. In this lesson, you will see 2 other arguments you can give.

| w | opens the file for writing. But overwrites all previous file data |
| --- | --- |
| a | opens the file for writing. But appends new data to the end of the file |

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ TIP - Python will look for the file in the same directory as where your `.py` file is saved. If it cannot find the file in the same directory, it will create a file with the filename given as an argument.

# Using the `w` parameter

Did you notice that the data was added to the end of line 3?

# The `.write()` command

This will add a line to your file as a string datatype. It will not add a new line break at the end of a line. You need to do that manually with `'\n`

- example without `'\n'`
