# 18 - Slicing Lists

As you know by now, items in a list are indexed, but what if we donâ€™t want to focus on all items of a list?

similar to how we can use substring indexing to focus on sections of a string, in the example below i demonstrate how to do the same with items of a list or array.

In the example above, we can see that although although I indicated items between 0:3, Python counts from 0 and up to 3 (not including 3).

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Think about when we use a for loop to iterate through all items of a list. If we write:

```python
for i in range(0, len(shopping_list):
		print(shopping_list[i])
```

We are effectively saying from items 0 to 5 because there are 5 items in the list. Since we start counting from 0, there isnâ€™t really a 5th item ðŸ¤”. 
This is ok since we are counting up to item 5 and not including 5 .

# Negative indexing?

Python also supports counting from the end of a list by using a negative count.

Suppose I wanted to print the last 2 items from the list. I could write this in several ways.

`print(shopping_list[-2:])`

`print(shopping_list[3:])`

The absence of a number index after the colon just means that it can continue to the end of the list.
