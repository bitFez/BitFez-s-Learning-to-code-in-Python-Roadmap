# 16 - Lists and iteration

This is probably one of the most commonly used skills in programming. 

Back in lesson [10 - For Loops](10%20-%20For%20Loops%20a161c39578d44fedb9085948d7594920.md), I mentioned that loops make it easy to complete an instruction like messaging happy birthday to every user in an organisation with a simple loop. Look at the simple example below.

The example above is overly simplified. We will soon go into more complex examples.

Notice that I set the range of the loop between 0 and 4? in lesson [6.5 String functions](6%205%20String%20functions%201ef09dc9a7eb4960b07bf72c85783dc7.md), I showed you the `len()` function that returned how many characters there are in a string. We can use the len function on a list too. however on a list it behaves differently. It returns how many items there are in a list/array.

```python
names = ["Alexy", "Hans", "Melvin", "Hakan"]

for i in range(0, len(names):
	print(f"Happy birthday, {names[i]}!")
```

This is useful if we don’t know how many items there are in a list.
