# 17 - List Functions

Other than append there are a bunch of useful functions you will need to know. Here are a few that you should practice using.

# `len()`

The `len()` function returns the number of items in a list. This is sooooo useful! In fact itâ€™s so useful, I already showed this function in lesson [16 - Lists and iteration](16%20-%20Lists%20and%20iteration%20c2d86cd56f3049d88f5b41ff5d2d5721.md).

Imagine not knowing how many items there are in a list and needing to perform some action over it.

```python
fruit = ["Apple", "Orange", "Strawberry"]
no_of_fruit = len(fruit)
print(f"The are {no_of_fruit} items of fruit in the list.")

>>> The are 3 items of fruit in the list.
```

## `remove()`

The remove function will remove an item you specify. The problem is that it will only remove the first item it finds with that name.

# `pop()`

The pop function will remove an item based on its indexed location in the list.

In the above example,  item 1 (or the second item counting from zero) is popped out of the list.

# `Sort()`

The sort function will order items in the list from A-Z or smallest to largest value.

### Sorting in reverse order

We can sort from Z-A or biggest to smaller by adding the `reverse=True` attribute.

note: The order is reversed in alphabetical order.

# `.reverse()`

Take a note! This method is not reversing in the same way as `sort(reverse=True)` . In this case its changes the order of the items regardless of their alphabetic or alphanumeric order.

# `count()`
