# 10 - For Loops

Repetition is another really useful function of programming.

<aside>
üí° A `for` loop is useful when you know how many times an instruction needs to be repeated.

</aside>

I want to repeat saying ‚ÄúHappy birthday!‚Äù 10 times. This is similar to what Mark  Zuckerberg mentions in the video above without sending the message to individual users.

# The local variable

<aside>
üí° The local variable is similar to any other variable in a code file. It only exists in the for loop however. it can be named any suitable name. For example, if I am saying 5 times I could change `i` to `greetingNumber`.

</aside>

```python
for greetingNumber in range(5):
		print("G'day mate")
```

The local variable is just a number. See what happens below when I print the local variable out.

The range is set as 5. So the instruction will repeat 5 times. Did you notice counting started at 0?

# The range

So above, I stated the range was 5 and the counting started from 0. What if I wanted to start the count from 7 for example?

I can set a set range for the counting to begin and end.

This time did you notice the range began at 7 and ended at 12? Python will count up between 2 given numbers starting from the first given number.

# Tasks

It goes without saying all of the below tasks should be completed using a `for` loop

- [ ]  repeat saying ‚ÄúI am Groot‚Äù 50 times
- [ ]  print out the numbers 1 - 100
- [ ]  print out the numbers 14 - 33

## More challenging tasks - practice concatenation

- [ ]  print out the word `‚ÄúNumber: ‚Äú i`  . i should be a number starting from 10 to 20.
- [ ]  print out ‚Üí 1 Mississippi, 2 Mississippi ... up to 100 Mississippi.
- [ ]  print out a 10 times table each line should look like this:
    
    `x * y = xy`
