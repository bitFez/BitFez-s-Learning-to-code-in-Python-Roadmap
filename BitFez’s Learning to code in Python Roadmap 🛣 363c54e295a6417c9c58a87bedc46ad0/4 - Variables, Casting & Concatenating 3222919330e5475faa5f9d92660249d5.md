# 4 - Variables, Casting & Concatenating

# Variables

Variables are a key programming feature. Sometimes the programs we write need to have values that change or need to be stored to recall later on. 

We see this often in games.

### Pok√©mon

In both examples above, we can see where a user is expected to enter their name. For for the scoreboard and one so that the game mechanics can keep referring to it during the game story.

# Variables in Python

<aside>
üí° Some golden rules when assigning variables:

1. Variable names cannot take the name of a python reserved keyword such as `print`
2. The name goes on the left ‚¨Ö & the value goes on the right ‚û°
3. Just use 1 `=` . remember that `==` is a comparative operator. 
4. variable names cannot have spaces.
       ‚ùé `high score = 145`
       ‚úÖ `high_score = 145`

</aside>

So, if wanted to create a variable called `score` and assign the value `0`, I would write:

```python
score = 0
```

If I wanted to output the value, I could write:

```python
print(score)
```

Take a look at how I can assign and re-assign the variable with a new value.

## Tasks

Write a program with all of the following variables and then print them to the screen.

- [ ]  your name
- [ ]  your age
- [ ]  your favourite TV show
- [ ]  your favourite film
- [ ]  your favourite song

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Remember! No spaces in variable names üò†
There are 2 methods for naming variables which are standard practice:

1 - Use snake casing ‚Üí `vat_rate = 0.2` ‚Üêwords separated by underscore
2 - Use camel casing ‚Üí `vatRate = 0.2` ‚Üêwords separated a capital letter

# Concatenating

This is just a fancy word for *joining*. Everything in Python is considered an object and print statements can only handle one type of object at a time. for example:

```python
name = "Batman"
print("I'm " + name)

Output >>> I'm Batman
```

Problems occur when we try to concatenate 2 objects that are different datatypes.

[As you can see from the above example, Python can‚Äôt concatenate (***join)*** the integer datatype with the string objects.](https://replit.com/@bitFez/ex7#main.py)

# Casting

Do you remember how when we performed math using Python, the program evaluated the statement 2+2 to 4? We can use some functions to convert datatypes so they match other objects in the print statement.

| str() | converts a datatype to a string |
| --- | --- |
| int() | converts an object to an integer |
| float() | converts an object to a number with decimals. |
