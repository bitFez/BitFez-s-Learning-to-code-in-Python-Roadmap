# 15 - Lists/Arrays

Although *lists* and *arrays* are not the same thing, with Python, we use both words interchangeably. The *WHY*, is not important at this point 😊

When we assign a variable , we are able to store, retrieve and change 1 single item of data.

```python
fruit = "Apple"
```

A list (or an array) is a data structure that allows us to store more than one item of data.

```python
fruit = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear", "Banana"]
```

<aside>
💡 Key points to create an array
- Naming should be just like with a variable. i.e.  the name should begin with a lowercase, use snake or camel casing to separate words & reserved words such as `print` cannot be used.
- square brackets must be used `[` `]` on either end.

# Indexing list items

Items are all indexed in a list and can be accessed separately.

We can either print a whole list out to the screen or individual items. 

If I want to print an individual item, I will refer to item using square brackets. For example, the apple is the first item so I would write `fruit[0]`.

# Adding Items to a List

In order to add items to a list, we need to use the `append()` function. 

```python
fruit = ["Apple", "Orange", "Pear", "Banana"]

# adding another item
fruit.append("Strawberry")
```

## Adding items using a loop

In this example, I am using a loop to add items to a list

```python
fruit = []
for number in range(5):
		item = input("Give me the name of a fruit")
		fruit.append(item)

print(f"You said : {fruit}.")
```

# Re-assigning a list value

in the same way that I can re-assign a variable, I can re-assign an item in a list.

### Variable example

```python
age = 15
age = 16
```

This replaces 15 with 16

### List Example

```python
fruit = ["apple", "orange", "kiwi"]
fruit[1] = "pear"
```

This replaces 🍊 with 🍐

The `1` represents the list item to replace.
