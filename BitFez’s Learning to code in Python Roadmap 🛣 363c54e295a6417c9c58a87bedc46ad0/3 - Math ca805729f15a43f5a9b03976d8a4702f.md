# 3 - Math

As well as displaying text, programming languages will also work out math. An example of this could be:

Earlier on in [1 - Printing Basics](1%20-%20Printing%20Basics%20b9a0e9a8f7724636be389b3f3b8ca5e8.md), I wrote that `print` is a function. You can tell a function in Python because it has parenthesis `( )`. 

## Operators

| Operator | Python symbol |
| --- | --- |
| + | + |
| - | - |
| x | * |
| √∑ | / |

In the above example, Python is evaluating everything between the parenthesis. Have you noticed that `2+2 * 2` is 6? You probably learned about  BIDMAS (or BODMAS) in math lessons. multiplication happens before addition in the order of operations. 

### Tasks

Try some maths in python

- [ ]  100*10
- [ ]  10/2
- [ ]  10*2*2
- [ ]  7.5*2

## Some more operators

A couple more operators you will need to learn are the DIV and MOD operators. These are often useful in programming and frequently come up in exam questions.

| Operator | Operator | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MOD | % | remainder (or modular) division only shows the remainder of any division. |
| DIV | // | integer (or floor) division removes the decimal point and remainder of any division. |
| equal to | == | This is a comparative operator. You will learn more about these in the coming lessons. It is used to compare 1 object to another object. |

### Tasks

write print statements to

- [ ]  result in a remainder of 2 (eg. 10 MOD 4)
- [ ]  result in a remainder of 1 (eg. 10 MOD 3)
- [ ]  result in a floor division of 2
- [ ]  result in a floor division of 3

## Evaluating to `True` or `False`

All operations in a computer eventually boil down to whether a process is:

- `True` or `False`
- `0` or `1`
- `on` or `off`

We can use the comparative operator `==` to evaluate whether statements are `True` or `False`

### Tasks

- [ ]  2*7-2==12 ‚Üí `True`
- [ ]  14+2/2 ==7 ‚Üí `False`
- [ ]  ‚Äú2+2‚Äù==4 ‚Üí `False`
- [ ]  Solve the above so that 2+2*2 == 8 without changing the order of the numbers. üí° think BIDMAS
