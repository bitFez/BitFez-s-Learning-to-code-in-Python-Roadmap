# 1 - Printing Basics

The most basic skill to learn when coding is how to output a message to the screen.

We must use a function to do this. In python the keyword for this function is `print()`. Python will take whatever is between the parenthesis and output it to the screen.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ 3 key rules you need to know to begin with:

1. `print` is always written in *lowercase*. In fact, all python keyword commands are.
2. There must always be parenthesis and whatever is to be outputted must be placed within the `( )`.
3. Text that is outputted must be placed within quotes `" "`
