# 19 - Tuples

A tuple is very similar to a list except that items cannot be appended, removed or re-assigned!

You may have read the Isaac Asimov books “Runaround**”, “***I, Robot**”*** or seen the film adaptation. He introduced **The Three Laws Of Robotics** which were:

> **First Law**
A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
**Second Law**
A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
**Third Law**
A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
> 

It would make sense to hardcode these rules in to robots using a tuple right? You wouldn’t want that rule changed.

A tuple is written using parenthesis instead of square brackets

```python
bitFez_laws = ("Stay in school", "Be good to your parents", "Stay cool")
```

Items can be accessed in the same way.

```python
print(bitFez_laws[0])
```

# Task (not many here!)

- [ ]  Write a small tuple and try to print items, append, remove or pop them.
