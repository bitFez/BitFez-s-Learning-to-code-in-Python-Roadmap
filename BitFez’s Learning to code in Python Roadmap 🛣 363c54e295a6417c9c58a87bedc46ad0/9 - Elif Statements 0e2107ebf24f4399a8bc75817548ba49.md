# 9 - Elif Statements

Sometimes an if statement does not allow for enough possible outcomes. Look at the example below. 

<aside>
💡 Aisha wants to input today’s weather forecast into a program she is writing. She wants the program to give a comment based on the temperature.

if the temperature is less than 0, the program should output → “it may be safer to stay in”
if the temperature is between 0 and 5 → “It will be freezing today”
if the temperature is between 6 and 10 → “It will be quite chilly today”
if between 11 and 18 → “it will be a mild day”
if between 18 and 25 → “The temperature will be very hot today, remember sunscreen!”
and for all other temperatures output → “It will be scorchio!

</aside>

You’ll be writing the program for the above scenario in just a moment. Take a look at the example syntax below for a similar solution.

```python
goals = int(input("How many did arsenal score last night?"))

if goals == 0:
  print("Arsenlol always make me laugh 😂")
elif goals >=1 or goals <=2:
  print("its nice to see they score a few")
elif goals >2 or goals <5:
  print("It sounds like it may have been an exciting game")
else:
  print("Wow! Arsenal must have thrashed the other team")
```

Key points from the above example:

- The Boolean expression on the first line needs to start with an `if`
- All other Boolean expressions must start as `elif`
- The last statement should be an `else` statement but is not necessary.
- Notice that some lines have more than 1 `True` or `False` comparison that is combined with an `or` operator.
    - When this is the case, you must refer to the object being compared twice. eg.
        
        ✔ `goals >0 or goals <=2` 
        
        ❌ `goals >0 or <=2`
        
    

## Another example

A popular game we’ve all probably played to help make a decision such as what you’re watching on TV has been Rock-Paper-Scissors. In this example, you will see 2 things that are new to you.

- Firstly, line 1 `from random import choice` allows Python to load a function to make random choices from a library of functions called `random`. You will learn more about the random library later.
- Secondly, line 3 introduces a list. This is a data structure. Again, you will learn more on this later. It’s a way to store multiple values under 1 variable name.
- This time the `if` Boolean expression uses an `and` operator checking to see if 2 conditions are `True`. You will finish this code off for task 2!
